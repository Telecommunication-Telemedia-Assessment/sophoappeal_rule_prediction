# dnn_retraining

In the following papers:

* Mai et al. 2012 "Detecting Rule of Simplicity from Photos" and
* Mai et al. 2011 "Rule of Thirds Detection from Photograph"

approaches to detect simplicity and rule of thirds for images are proposed, both algorithms use saliency models to estimate the final classification decision.

In this repo, the published labeled dataset is used to re-train DNNs for the same tasks.
